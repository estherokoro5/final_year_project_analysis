## Effect of Different Compost Amendments on Soil, Vine Length and Yield of Cucumber (_cucumis sativus_) in Awka.
## Overview
This project investigates the effects of two compost mixtures-poultry manure mixed with grass weeds and sawdust (PGS) and goat manure mixed with broadleaf weeds and sawdust (GBS)-on soil properties and cucumber (_cucumis sativus_) growth in an experimental farm at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria. This analysis was performed using Python and the project examines soil nutrients and crop yields.
